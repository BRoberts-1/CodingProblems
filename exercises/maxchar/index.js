// --- Directions
// Given a string, return the character that is most
// commonly used in the string.
// --- Examples
// maxChar("abcccccccd") === "c"
// maxChar("apple 1231111") === "1"

// Other ways to rephrase the same question:
// What is the most common character in a string?
// Does string A have the same characters as sting B(is it an anagram?)?
// Does the given string have any repeated characters in in?

function maxChar(str) {}
